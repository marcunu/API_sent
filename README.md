# Documents

* 01 - API executable: data collection via API from `Strava`.
* 02 - Srap executable: data collection via Web Scraping.
* 03 - Visualization: graphs of the information obtained..



# Steps

* `Step 1`: search for a website that allows us to collect information through APIs and obtain such information.
        
* `Step 2`: collect information from the internet with the web scraping method.

* `Step 3`: take the information obtained in the two previous steps, clean it and export it in `.csv` format.

* `Step 4`: link information and graphics in a way that is easily understood by another person.


# DataFrames

3 different datasets have been generated throughout the project:

   * Strava Dataset: information obtained via API.
   * Marathon Dataset: information obtained via Web Scraping.
   * Hong Kong Marathon 2016: dataset downloaded from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/melvincheung/hong-kong-marathon-2016)
